### Manual testing

- Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Lighthouse Testing

- The performance test of all the pages was done with Lighthouse through Google Chrome Developer Tools, both for desktop and mobile devices.

  - Lighthouse test results for Desktop:

## Deployment

### Creating the Repository

I have used the [Code Institute Python Essentials Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) 
for creating a terminal where my Python code will generate its output. The steps were as follows:

- Click the Use this template button
- A New Repository page will appear, write a Repository name and a short description and press Create repository from template
- Press the green Gitpod button to create your project workspace and start developing your website

### Deploying on Heroku

- Create an account and login into Heroku website
- Click "New -> Create new app" button
- Insert your app's Name and Choose your region then click the "Create App" button
- Into the Settings tab go to "Config vars" section and click "Reveal Config Vars"
- Enter the PORT in the KEY section and 8000 for its value, then click "Add"
- Enter the CREDS in the KEY section and add all the files from the creds.json file for its value, then click "Add"
- Go to "Buildpacks" section and click "Add buildpack"
- Firstly add the Python buildpack then NodeJs
- Into the Deploy tab go to "Deployment method" and select Github
- After that go to "App connected to GitHub" and look for your GitHub repository name to link it
- You can now choose to either manually or automatically deploy your app to Heroku
- With automatic deploys enabled, Heroku will build a new version of the app each time a change has been
  pushed to the repository
- Manual deploys means your app will be updated only when you manually click to deploy it
- When the deploying is finished, a link will be provided to you for accessing your app

The live link can be found [here](https://space-quiz-pp3.herokuapp.com/)

### Forking the Repository

You can fork the repository by following these steps:

- Go to the GitHub repository.
- Locate the Fork button on the top-right corner of the page and click on it.
- Select an owner for the forked repository and give it a name.
- Add a description of the repository if you want to.
- Choose whether to copy only the default branch or all of the branches to the new fork (Only the default branch is copied by default).
- Click Create fork.

### Cloning the Repository

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

- Log into GitHub.
- Find the repository you want to clone.
- To the left of the big green 'Gitpod' button, click the 'Code' dropdown menu.
- Copy the HTTPS or SSH address as required.
- Open Git Bash.
- Set up your new directory.
- Type "git clone the_SSH_or_https_address".
- Hit enter and the code will be cloned.
